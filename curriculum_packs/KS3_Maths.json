      "text": "September 2013 \nMathematics – key stage 3 \n2 \nPurpose of study \nMathematics is a creative and highly inter-connected discipline that has been developed \nover centuries, providing the solution to some of history’s most intriguing problems. It is \nessential to everyday life, critical to science, technology and engineering, and necessary \nfor financial literacy and most forms of employment. A high-quality mathematics education \ntherefore provides a foundation for understanding the world, the ability to reason \nmathematically, an appreciation of the beauty and power of mathematics, and a sense of \nenjoyment and curiosity about the subject. \nAims \nThe national curriculum for mathematics aims to ensure that all pupils: \n become fluent in the fundamentals of mathematics, including through varied and \nfrequent practice with increasingly complex problems over time, so that pupils develop \nconceptual understanding and the ability to recall and apply knowledge rapidly and \naccurately. \n reason mathematically by following a line of enquiry, conjecturing relationships and \ngeneralisations, and developing an argument, justification or proof using mathematical \nlanguage \n can solve problems by applying their mathematics to a variety of routine and non-\nroutine problems with increasing sophistication, including breaking down problems into \na series of simpler steps and persevering in seeking solutions. \nMathematics is an interconnected subject in which pupils need to be able to move fluently \nbetween representations of mathematical ideas. The programme of study for key stage 3 \nis organised into apparently distinct domains, but pupils should build on key stage 2 and \nconnections across mathematical ideas to develop fluency, mathematical reasoning and \ncompetence in solving increasingly sophisticated problems. They should also apply their \nmathematical knowledge in science, geography, computing and other subjects. \nDecisions about progression should be based on the security of pupils’ understanding and \ntheir readiness to progress to the next stage. Pupils who grasp concepts rapidly should be \nchallenged through being offered rich and sophisticated problems before any acceleration \nthrough new content in preparation for key stage 4. Those who are not sufficiently fluent \nshould consolidate their understanding, including through additional practice, before \nmoving on. \nInformation and communication technology (ICT) \nCalculators should not be used as a substitute for good written and mental arithmetic. In \nsecondary schools, teachers should use their judgement about when ICT tools should be \nused. \nMathematics – key stage 3 \n3 \nSpoken language \nThe national curriculum for mathematics reflects the importance of spoken language in \npupils’ development across the whole curriculum – cognitively, socially and linguistically. \nThe quality and variety of language that pupils hear and speak are key factors in \ndeveloping their mathematical vocabulary and presenting a mathematical justification, \nargument or proof. They must be assisted in making their thinking clear to themselves as \nwell as others and teachers should ensure that pupils build secure foundations by using \ndiscussion to probe and remedy their misconceptions. \nAttainment targets \nBy the end of key stage 3, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, \nskills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study. \nSchools are not required by law to teach the example content in [square brackets] \nor the content indicated as being ‘non-statutory’. \nMathematics – key stage 3 \n4 \nKey stage 3 \nWorking mathematically \nThrough the mathematics content, pupils should be taught to: \nDevelop fluency \n consolidate their numerical and mathematical capability from key stage 2 and extend \ntheir understanding of the number system and place value to include decimals, \nfractions, powers and roots \n select and use appropriate calculation strategies to solve increasingly complex \nproblems \n use algebra to generalise the structure of arithmetic, including to formulate \nmathematical relationships \n substitute values in expressions, rearrange and simplify expressions, and solve \nequations \n move freely between different numerical, algebraic, graphical and diagrammatic \nrepresentations [for example, equivalent fractions, fractions and decimals, and \nequations and graphs] \n develop algebraic and graphical fluency, including understanding linear and simple \nquadratic functions \n use language and properties precisely to analyse numbers, algebraic expressions, 2-D \nand 3-D shapes, probability and statistics. \nReason mathematically \n extend their understanding of the number system;
