      "text": "September 2013 \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n2 \nPurpose of study \nEnglish has a pre-eminent place in education and in society. A high-quality education in \nEnglish will teach pupils to speak and write fluently so that they can communicate their \nideas and emotions to others and through their reading and listening, others can \ncommunicate with them. Through reading in particular, pupils have a chance to develop \nculturally, emotionally, intellectually, socially and spiritually. Literature, especially, plays a \nkey role in such development. Reading also enables pupils both to acquire knowledge and \nto build on what they already know. All the skills of language are essential to participating \nfully as a member of society; pupils, therefore, who do not learn to speak, read and write \nfluently and confidently are effectively disenfranchised. \nAims \nThe overarching aim for English in the national curriculum is to promote high standards of \nlanguage and literacy by equipping pupils with a strong command of the spoken and \nwritten word, and to develop their love of literature through widespread reading for \nenjoyment. The national curriculum for English aims to ensure that all pupils: \n read easily, fluently and with good understanding \n develop the habit of reading widely and often, for both pleasure and information \n acquire a wide vocabulary, an understanding of grammar and knowledge of linguistic \nconventions for reading, writing and spoken language \n appreciate our rich and varied literary heritage \n write clearly, accurately and coherently, adapting their language and style in and for a \nrange of contexts, purposes and audiences \n use discussion in order to learn; they should be able to elaborate and explain clearly \ntheir understanding and ideas \n are competent in the arts of speaking and listening, making formal presentations, \ndemonstrating to others and participating in debate. \nSpoken language \nThe national curriculum for English reflects the importance of spoken language in pupils’ \ndevelopment across the whole curriculum – cognitively, socially and linguistically. Spoken \nlanguage continues to underpin the development of pupils’ reading and writing during key \nstage 3 and teachers should therefore ensure pupils’ confidence and competence in this \narea continue to develop. Pupils should be taught to understand and use the conventions \nfor discussion and debate, as well as continuing to develop their skills in working \ncollaboratively with their peers to discuss reading, writing and speech across the \ncurriculum. \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n3 \nReading and writing \nReading at key stage 3 should be wide, varied and challenging. Pupils should be expected \nto read whole books, to read in depth and to read for pleasure and information. \nPupils should continue to develop their knowledge of and skills in writing, refining their \ndrafting skills and developing resilience to write at length. They should be taught to write \nformal and academic essays as well as writing imaginatively. They should be taught to \nwrite for a variety of purposes and audiences across a range of contexts. This requires an \nincreasingly wide knowledge of vocabulary and grammar. \nOpportunities for teachers to enhance pupils’ vocabulary will arise naturally from their \nreading and writing. Teachers should show pupils how to understand the relationships \nbetween words, how to understand nuances in meaning, and how to develop their \nunderstanding of, and ability to use, figurative language. \nPupils should be taught to control their speaking and writing consciously, understand why \nsentences are constructed as they are and to use Standard English. They should \nunderstand and use age-appropriate vocabulary, including linguistic and literary \nterminology, for discussing their reading, writing and spoken language. This involves \nconsolidation, practice and discussion of language. It is important that pupils learn the \ncorrect grammatical terms in English and that these terms are integrated within teaching. \nTeachers should build on the knowledge and skills that pupils have been taught at key \nstage 2. Decisions about progression should be based on the security of pupils’ linguistic \nknowledge, skills and understanding and their readiness to progress to the next stage. \nPupils whose linguistic development is more advanced should be challenged through \nbeing offered opportunities for increased breadth and depth in reading and writing. Those \nwho are less fluent should consolidate their knowledge, understanding and skills, including \nthrough additional practice. \nGlossary \nA non-statutory Glossary is provided for teachers. \nAttainment targets \nBy the end of key stage 3, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, \nskills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study. \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n4 \nKey stage 3 \nSubject content \nReading \nPupils should be taught to: \n develop an appreciation and love of reading, and read increasingly challenging material \nindependently through: \n reading a wide range of fiction and non-fiction, including in particular whole books, \nshort stories, poems and plays with a wide coverage of genres, historical periods, \nforms and authors. The range will include high-quality works from: \n• English literature, both pre-1914 and contemporary, including prose, poetry \nand drama \n• Shakespeare (two plays) \n• seminal world literature \n choosing and reading books independently for challenge, interest and enjoyment. \n re-reading books encountered earlier to increase familiarity with them and provide \na basis for making comparisons. \n understand increasingly challenging texts through: \n learning new vocabulary, relating it explicitly to known vocabulary and \nunderstanding it with the help of context and dictionaries \n making inferences and referring to evidence in the text \n knowing the purpose, audience for and context of the writing and drawing on this \nknowledge to support comprehension \n checking their understanding to make sure that what they have read makes \nsense. \n read critically through: \n knowing how language, including figurative language, vocabulary choice, \ngrammar, text structure and organisational features, presents meaning \n recognising a range of poetic conventions and understanding how these have \nbeen used \n studying setting, plot, and characterisation, and the effects of these \n understanding how the work of dramatists is communicated effectively through \nperformance and how alternative staging allows for different interpretations of a \nplay \n making critical comparisons across texts \n studying a range of authors, including at least two authors in depth each year. \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n5 \nWriting \nPupils should be taught to: \n write accurately, fluently, effectively and at length for pleasure and information through: \n writing for a wide range of purposes and audiences, including: \n• well-structured formal expository and narrative essays \n• stories, scripts, poetry and other imaginative writing \n• notes and polished scripts for talks and presentations \n• a range of other narrative and non-narrative texts, including arguments, and \npersonal and formal letters \n summarising and organising material, and supporting ideas and arguments with \nany necessary factual detail \n applying their growing knowledge of vocabulary, grammar and text structure to \ntheir writing and selecting the appropriate form \n drawing on knowledge of literary and rhetorical devices from their reading and \nlistening to enhance the impact of their writing \n plan, draft, edit and proof-read through: \n considering how their writing reflects the audiences and purposes for which it was \nintended \n amending the vocabulary, grammar and structure of their writing to improve its \ncoherence and overall effectiveness \n paying attention to accurate grammar, punctuation and spelling; applying the \nspelling patterns and rules set out in English Appendix 1 to the key stage 1 and 2 \nprogrammes of study for English. \nGrammar and vocabulary \nPupils should be taught to: \n consolidate and build on their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary through: \n extending and applying the grammatical knowledge set out in English Appendix 2 \nto the key stage 1 and 2 programmes of study to analyse more challenging texts \n studying the effectiveness and impact of the grammatical features of the texts \nthey read \n drawing on new vocabulary and grammatical constructions from their reading and \nlistening, and using these consciously in their writing and speech to achieve \nparticular effects \n knowing and understanding the differences between spoken and written \nlanguage, including differences associated with formal and informal registers, and \nbetween Standard English and other varieties of English \n using Standard English confidently in their own writing and speech \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n6 \n discussing reading, writing and spoken language with precise and confident use \nof linguistic and literary terminology.1 \nSpoken English \nPupils should be taught to: \n speak confidently and effectively, including through: \n using Standard English confidently in a range of formal and informal contexts, \nincluding classroom discussion \n giving short speeches and presentations, expressing their own ideas and keeping \nto the point \n participating in formal debates and structured discussions, summarising and/or \nbuilding on what has been said \n improvising, rehearsing and performing play scripts and poetry in order to \ngenerate language and discuss language use and meaning, using role, intonation, \ntone, volume, mood, silence, stillness and action to add impact."

      "text": "of terms used within the programmes of study as a whole. \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n7 \nGlossary for the programmes of study for English \n(non-statutory)\n\nThe following glossary includes all the technical grammatical terms used in the \nprogrammes of study for English, as well as others that might be useful. It is intended as \nan aid for teachers, not as the body of knowledge that should be learnt by pupils. Apart \nfrom a few which are used only in schools (for example, root word), the terms below are \nused with the meanings defined here in most modern books on English grammar. It is \nrecognised that there are different schools of thought on grammar, but the terms defined \nhere clarify those being used in the programmes of study. For further details, teachers \nshould consult the many books that are available. \nTerms in definitions \nAs in any tightly structured area of knowledge, grammar, vocabulary and spelling involve a \nnetwork of technical concepts that help to define each other. Consequently, the definition \nof one concept builds on other concepts that are equally technical. Concepts that are \ndefined elsewhere in the glossary are hyperlinked. For some concepts, the technical \ndefinition may be slightly different from the meaning that some teachers may have learnt at \nschool or may have been using with their own pupils; in these cases, the more familiar \nmeaning is also discussed. \nTerm Guidance Example \nactive voice An active verb has its usual pattern \nof subject and object (in contrast with \nthe passive). \nActive: The school arranged a visit. \nPassive: A visit was arranged by \nthe school. \nadjective The surest way to identify adjectives \nis by the ways they can be used: \n before a noun, to make the \nnoun’s meaning more specific \n(i.e. to modify\n the noun), or \n after the verb be, as its \ncomplement\n. \nAdjectives cannot be modified by \nother adjectives. This distinguishes \nthem from nouns\n, which can be. \nAdjectives are sometimes called \n‘describing words’ because they pick \nout single characteristics such as \nsize or colour. This is often true, but \nit doesn’t help to distinguish \nadjectives from other word classes, \nThe pupils did some really good \nwork. [adjective used before a \nnoun, to modify it] \nTheir work was good. [adjective \nused after the verb be, as its \ncomplement] \nNot adjectives: \nThe lamp glowed\n. [verb] \nIt was such a bright red! [noun] \nHe spoke loudly. [adverb] \nIt was a French grammar book. \n[noun] \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n8 \nTerm Guidance Example \nbecause verbs, nouns and adverbs \ncan do the same thing. \nadverb The surest way to identify adverbs is \nby the ways they can be used: they \ncan modify a verb, an adjective\n, \nanother adverb or even a whole \nclause. \nAdverbs are sometimes said to \ndescribe manner or time. This is \noften true, but it doesn’t help to \ndistinguish adverbs from other word \nclasses that can be used as \nadverbials, such as \npreposition \nphrases, noun phrases and \nsubordinate clauses. \nUsha soon started snoring loudly. \n[adverbs modifying the verbs \nstarted and snoring] \nThat match was really exciting! \n[adverb modifying the adjective \nexciting] \nWe don’t get to play games very \noften. [adverb modifying the other \nadverb, often] \nFortunately, it didn’t rain. [adverb \nmodifying the whole clause ‘it didn’t \nrain’ by commenting on it] \nNot adverbs: \n Usha went up the stairs. \n[preposition phrase used as \nadverbial] \n She finished her work this \nevening. [noun phrase used as \nadverbial] \n She finished when the teacher \ngot cross. [subordinate clause \nused as adverbial] \nadverbial An adverbial is a word or phrase that \nis used, like an adverb, to modify a \nverb or clause. Of course, adverbs"

      "text": "clause \nused as adverbial] \nadverbial An adverbial is a word or phrase that \nis used, like an adverb, to modify a \nverb or clause. Of course, adverbs\n\ncan be used as adverbials, but many \nother types of words and phrases \ncan be used this way, including \npreposition phrases and subordinate \nclauses. \nThe bus leaves in five minutes. \n[preposition phrase as adverbial: \nmodifies leaves] \nShe promised to see him last night. \n[noun phrase modifying either \npromised or see, according to the \nintended meaning] \nShe worked until she had finished. \n[subordinate clause as adverbial] \nantonym Two words are antonyms if their \nmeanings are opposites. \nhot – cold \nlight – dark \nlight – heavy \napostrophe Apostrophes have two completely \ndifferent uses: \n showing the place of missing \nletters (e.g. I’m for I am) \nI’m going out and I won’t\n be long. \n[showing missing letters] \nHannah’s mother went to town in \nJustin’s car. [marking possessives] \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n9 \nTerm Guidance Example \n marking possessives \n(e.g. Hannah’s mother). \narticle The articles the (definite) and a or an \n(indefinite) are the most common \ntype of determiner. \nThe dog found a bone in an old \nbox. \nauxiliary verb The auxiliary verbs are: be, have, do \nand the modal verbs. They can be \nused to make questions and \nnegative statements. In addition: \n be is used in the progressive and \npassive \n have is used in the perfect \n do is used to form questions and \nnegative statements if no other \nauxiliary verb is present \nThey are\n winning the match. [be \nused in the progressive] \nHave you finished your picture? \n[have used to make a question, \nand the perfect] \nNo, I don’t know him. [do used to \nmake a negative; no other auxiliary \nis present] \nWill you come with me or not? \n[modal verb will used to make a \nquestion about the other person’s \nwillingness] \nclause A clause is a special type of phrase \nwhose head is a verb. Clauses can \nsometimes be complete sentences. \nClauses may be \nmain or \nsubordinate. \nTraditionally, a clause had to have a \nfinite verb, but most modern \ngrammarians also recognise non-\nfinite clauses. \nIt was raining. [single-clause \nsentence] \nIt was raining but we were indoors. \n[two finite clauses] \nIf you are coming to the party, \nplease let us know. [finite \nsubordinate clause inside a finite \nmain clause] \nUsha went upstairs to play on her \ncomputer. [non-finite clause] \ncohesion A text has cohesion if it is clear how \nthe meanings of its parts fit together. \nCohesive devices\n can help to do \nthis. \nIn the example, there are repeated \nreferences to the same thing (shown \nby the different style pairings), and \nthe logical relations, such as time \nand cause, between different parts \nare clear. \nA visit has been arranged for \nYear \n6, to the Mountain Peaks Field \nStudy Centre, leaving school at \n9.30am. This is an overnight \nvisit. The centre has beautiful \ngrounds and a nature trail. During \nthe afternoon, the children will \nfollow the trail. \ncohesive device Cohesive devices are words used to \nshow how the different parts of a text \nfit together. In other words, they \ncreate cohesion\n. \nJulia’s dad bought her a football. \nThe football was expensive! \n[determiner; refers us back to a \nparticular football] \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n10 \nTerm Guidance Example \nSome examples of cohesive devices \nare: \n determiners and pronouns, which \ncan refer back to earlier words \n conjunctions and adverbs, which \ncan make relations between \nwords clear \n ellipsis of expected words. \nJoe was given a bike for \nChristmas. He liked it very much. \n[the pronouns refer back to Joe \nand the bike] \nWe’ll be going shopping before we \ngo to the park. [conjunction; makes \na relationship of time clear] \nI’m afraid we’re going to have to \nwait for the next train. Meanwhile\n, \nwe could have a cup of tea. \n[adverb; refers back to the time of \nwaiting] \nWhere are you going? [ ] To \nschool! [ellipsis of the expected \nwords I’m going; links the answer \nback to the question] \ncomplement A verb’s subject complement adds \nmore information about its subject, \nand its object complement does the \nsame for its \nobject. \nUnlike the verb’s object, its \ncomplement may be an adjective. \nThe verb be normally has a \ncomplement. \nShe is our teacher\n. [adds more \ninformation about the subject, she] \nThey seem very competent. [adds \nmore information about the subject, \nthey] \nLearning makes me happy\n. [adds \nmore information about the object, \nme] \ncompound, \ncompounding \nA compound word contains at least \ntwo root words in its morphology\n; \ne.g. whiteboard, superman. \nCompounding is very important in \nEnglish. \nblackbird, blow-dry, bookshop, ice-\ncream, English teacher, inkjet, one-\neyed, bone-dry, baby-sit, \ndaydream, outgrow \nconjunction A conjunction links two words or \nphrases together. \nThere are two main types of \nconjunctions: \n co-ordinating\n conjunctions (e.g. \nand) link two words or phrases \ntogether as an equal pair \n subordinating conjunctions (e.g. \nwhen) introduce a \nsubordinate \nclause. \nJames bought a bat and ball. [links \nthe words bat and ball as an equal \npair] \nKylie is young but she can kick the \nball hard. [links two clauses as an \nequal pair] \nEveryone watches when Kyle does \nback-flips. [introduces a \nsubordinate clause] \nJoe can’t practise kicking because \nhe’s injured. [introduces a \nsubordinate clause] \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n11 \nTerm Guidance Example \nconsonant A sound which is produced when the \nspeaker closes off or obstructs the \nflow of air through the vocal tract, \nusually using lips, tongue or teeth. \nMost of the letters of the alphabet \nrepresent consonants. Only the \nletters a, e, i, o, u and y can \nrepresent vowel\n sounds. \n/p/ [flow of air stopped by the lips, \nthen released] \n/t/ [flow of air stopped by the \ntongue touching the roof of the \nmouth, then released] \n/f/ [flow of air obstructed by the \nbottom lip touching the top teeth] \n/s/ [flow of air obstructed by the tip \nof the tongue touching the gum \nline] \ncontinuous See progressive \nco-ordinate, \nco-ordination \nWords or phrases are co-ordinated if \nthey are linked as an equal pair by a \nco-ordinating conjunction\n (i.e. and, \nbut, or). \nIn the examples on the right, the co-\nordinated elements are shown in \nbold, and the conjunction is \nunderlined. \nThe difference between \nco-ordination and subordination\n is \nthat, in subordination, the two linked \nelements are not equal. \nSusan and Amra met in a café. \n[links the words Susan and Amra \nas an equal pair] \nThey talked and drank tea for an \nhour. [links two clauses as an \nequal pair] \nSusan got a bus but Amra \nwalked. [links two clauses as an \nequal pair] \nNot co-ordination: They ate before \nthey met. [before introduces a \nsubordinate clause] \ndeterminer A determiner specifies a noun as \nknown or unknown, and it goes \nbefore any modifiers (e.g. adjectives \nor other nouns). \nSome examples of determiners are: \n articles\n (the, a or an) \n demonstratives (e.g. this, those) \n possessives (e.g. my, your) \n quantifiers (e.g. some, every). \nthe home team [article, specifies \nthe team as known] \na good team [article, specifies the \nteam as unknown] \nthat pupil [demonstrative, known] \nJulia’s parents [possessive, known] \nsome big boys [quantifier, \nunknown] \nContrast: home the team, big some \nboys [both incorrect, because the \ndeterminer should come before \nother modifiers] \ndigraph A type of grapheme where two \nletters represent one phoneme. \nSometimes, these two letters are not \nnext to one another; this is called a \nThe digraph ea in ea\nch is \npronounced /i:/. \nThe digraph sh in shed is \npronounced /ʃ/. \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n12 \nTerm Guidance Example \nsplit digraph. The split digraph i–e in line is \npronounced /aɪ/. \nellipsis Ellipsis is the omission of a word or \nphrase which is expected and \npredictable. \nFrankie waved to Ivana and she"

Many \nwords in English have come from \nGreek, Latin or French. \nThe word school was borrowed \nfrom a Greek word ó÷ïëÞ (skholé) \nmeaning ‘leisure’. \nThe word verb comes from Latin \nverbum, meaning ‘word’. \nThe word mutton comes from \nFrench mouton, meaning ‘sheep’. \nfinite verb Every sentence typically has at least \none verb which is either past or \npresent tense. Such verbs are called \n‘finite’. The imperative verb in a \ncommand is also finite. \nVerbs that are not finite, such as \nparticiples or infinitives, cannot stand \non their own: they are linked to \nanother verb in the sentence. \nLizzie does\n the dishes every day. \n[present tense] \nEven Hana did the dishes \nyesterday. [past tense] \nDo the dishes, Naser! [imperative] \nNot finite verbs: \n I have done them. [combined \nwith the finite verb have] \n I will do them. [combined with \nthe finite verb will] \n I want to do them! [combined \nwith the finite verb want] \nfronting, fronted A word or phrase that normally \ncomes after the verb may be moved \nbefore the verb: when this happens, \nwe say it has been ‘fronted’. For \nexample, a fronted adverbial is an \nadverbial which has been moved \nbefore the verb. \nWhen writing fronted phrases, we \noften follow them with a comma. \nBefore we begin\n, make sure you’ve \ngot a pencil. \n[Without fronting: Make sure you’ve \ngot a pencil before we begin.] \nThe day after tomorrow\n, I’m visiting \nmy granddad. \n[Without fronting: I’m visiting my \ngranddad the day after tomorrow.] \nfuture Reference to future time can be \nmarked in a number of different ways \nin English. All these ways involve the \nuse of a present-tense verb\n. \nSee also tense. \nUnlike many other languages (such \nHe will leave tomorrow. [present-\ntense will followed by infinitive \nleave] \nHe may leave tomorrow. [present-\ntense may followed by infinitive \nleave] \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n13 \nTerm Guidance Example \nas French, Spanish or Italian), \nEnglish has no distinct ‘future tense’ \nform of the verb comparable with its \npresent and past tenses. \nHe leaves tomorrow. [present-\ntense leaves] \nHe is going to leave tomorrow. \n[present tense is followed by going \nto plus the infinitive leave] \nGPC See grapheme-phoneme \ncorrespondences."

Yes – he went \nthrough the door on the left. \nThe noise a dog makes is called a \nbark. Trees have bark\n. \nhomophone Two different words are \nhomophones if they sound exactly \nthe same when pronounced. \nhear, \nhere \nsome, sum \ninfinitive A verb’s infinitive is the basic form \nused as the head-word in a \ndictionary (e.g. walk, be). \nInfinitives are often used: \n after to \n after modal verbs\n. \nI want to walk. \nI will be quiet. \ninflection When we add -ed to walk, or change \nmouse to mice, this change of \nmorphology produces an inflection \n(‘bending’) of the basic word which \nhas special grammar (e.g. \npast tense \ndogs is an inflection of dog. \nwent is an inflection of go. \nbetter is an inflection of good. \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n14 \nTerm Guidance Example \nor plural). In contrast, adding -er to \nwalk produces a completely different \nword, walker, which is part of the \nsame word family. Inflection is \nsometimes thought of as merely a \nchange of ending, but, in fact, some \nwords change completely when \ninflected. \nintransitive verb A verb which does not need an \nobject in a sentence to complete its \nmeaning is described as intransitive. \nSee ‘transitive verb’\n. \nWe all laughed. \nWe would like to stay longer, but \nwe must leave\n. \nmain clause A sentence contains at least one \nclause which is not a subordinate \nclause; such a clause is a main \nclause. A main clause may contain \nany number of subordinate clauses. \nIt was raining but the sun was \nshining. [two main clauses] \nThe man who wrote it told me that \nit was true. [one main clause \ncontaining two subordinate \nclauses.] \nShe said, “It rained all day.” [one \nmain clause containing another.] \nmodal verb Modal verbs are used to change the \nmeaning of other verbs. They can \nexpress meanings such as certainty, \nability, or obligation. The main modal \nverbs are will, would, can, could, \nmay, might, shall, should, must and \nought. \nA modal verb only has finite forms \nand has no suffixes (e.g. I sing – he \nsings, but not I must – he musts). \nI can do this maths work by myself. \nThis ride may be too scary for you! \nYou should help your little brother. \nIs it going to rain? Yes, it might. \nCanning swim is important. [not \npossible because can must be \nfinite; contrast: Being able to swim \nis important, where being is not a \nmodal verb] \nmodify, modifier One word or phrase modifies \nanother by making its meaning more \nspecific. \nBecause the two words make a \nphrase\n, the ‘modifier’ is normally \nclose to the modified word. \nIn the phrase primary-school \nteacher: \n teacher is modified by primary-\nschool (to mean a specific kind \nof teacher) \n school is modified by primary \n(to mean a specific kind of \nschool). \nmorphology A word’s morphology is its internal \nmake-up in terms of root words and \nsuffixes or prefixes, as well as other \nkinds of change such as the change \ndogs has the morphological make-\nup: dog + s. \nunhelpfulness has the \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n15 \nTerm Guidance Example \nof mouse to mice. \nMorphology may be used to produce \ndifferent inflections of the same word \n(e.g. boy – boys), or entirely new \nwords (e.g. boy – boyish) belonging \nto the same word family. \nA word that contains two or more \nroot words is a compound (e.g. \nnews+paper, ice+cream). \nmorphological make-up: \nunhelpful + ness \n where unhelpful = un + helpful \n and helpful = help + ful \nnoun The surest way to identify nouns is \nby the ways they can be used after \ndeterminers\n such as the: for \nexample, most nouns will fit into the \nframe “The __ matters/matter.” \nNouns are sometimes called ‘naming \nwords’ because they name people, \nplaces and ‘things’; this is often true, \nbut it doesn’t help to distinguish \nnouns from other word classes\n. For \nexample, prepositions can name \nplaces and verbs can name ‘things’ \nsuch as actions. \nNouns may be classified as \ncommon (e.g. boy, day) or proper \n(e.g. Ivan, Wednesday), and also as \ncountable (e.g. thing, boy) or non-\ncountable (e.g. stuff, money). These \nclasses can be recognised by the \ndeterminers they combine with. \nOur dog bit the burglar on his \nbehind! \nMy big brother did an amazing \njump on his skateboard. \nActions speak louder than words. \nNot nouns: \n He’s behind you! [this names a \nplace, but is a preposition, not \na noun] \n She can jump so high! [this \nnames an action, but is a verb, \nnot a noun] \ncommon, countable: a book, \nbooks, two chocolates, one day, \nfewer ideas \ncommon, non-countable: money, \nsome chocolate, less imagination \nproper, countable: Marilyn, \nLondon, Wednesday \nnoun phrase A noun phrase is a phrase with a \nnoun as its head, e.g. some foxes, \nfoxes with bushy tails. Some \ngrammarians recognise one-word \nphrases, so that foxes are \nmultiplying would contain the noun \nfoxes acting as the head of the noun \nphrase foxes. \nAdult foxes can jump. [adult \nmodifies foxes, so adult belongs to \nthe noun phrase] \nAlmost all healthy adult foxes in \nthis area can jump. [all the other \nwords help to modify foxes, so they \nall belong to the noun phrase] \nobject An object is normally a noun, \npronoun or noun phrase that comes \nstraight after the verb, and shows \nwhat the verb is acting upon. \nObjects can be turned into the \nYear 2 designed puppets. [noun \nacting as object] \nI like that. [pronoun acting as \nobject] \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n16 \nTerm Guidance Example \nsubject of a passive verb, and \ncannot be adjectives (contrast with \ncomplements). \nSome people suggested a pretty \ndisplay. [noun phrase acting as \nobject] \nContrast: \n A display was suggested. \n[object of active verb becomes \nthe subject of the passive verb] \n Year 2 designed pretty. \n[incorrect, because adjectives \ncannot be objects] \nparticiple Verbs in English have two \nparticiples, called ‘present participle’ \n(e.g. walking, taking) and ‘past \nparticiple’ (e.g. walked, taken). \nUnfortunately, these terms can be \nconfusing to learners, because: \n they don’t necessarily have \nanything to do with present or \npast time \n although past participles are \nused as perfects\n (e.g. has eaten) \nthey are also used as passives \n(e.g. was eaten). \nHe is walking to school. [present \nparticiple in a progressive] \nHe has taken the bus to school. \n[past participle in a perfect] \nThe photo was taken in the rain. \n[past participle in a passive] \npassive The sentence It was eaten by our \ndog is the passive of Our dog ate it. \nA passive is recognisable from: \n the past participle\n form eaten \n the normal object (it) turned into \nthe subject \n the normal subject (our dog) \nturned into an optional \npreposition phrase with by as its \nhead \n the verb be(was), or some other \nverb such as get. \nContrast active. \nA verb is not ‘passive’ just because it \nhas a passive meaning: it must be \nthe passive version of an active verb. \nA visit was arranged\n by the school. \nOur cat got run over by a bus. \nActive versions: \n The school arranged a visit. \n A bus ran over our cat. \nNot passive: \n He received a warning. [past \ntense, active received] \n We had an accident. [past \ntense, active had] \npast tense Verbs in the past tense are \ncommonly used to: \nTom and Chris showed me their \nnew TV. [names an event in the \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n17 \nTerm Guidance Example \n talk about the past \n talk about imagined situations \n make a request sound more \npolite. \nMost verbs take a suffix –ed, to form \ntheir past tense, but many \ncommonly-used verbs are irregular. \nSee also tense. \npast] \nAntonio went on holiday to Brazil. \n[names an event in the past; \nirregular past of go] \nI wish I had a puppy. [names an \nimagined situation, not a situation \nin the past] \nI was hoping you’d help tomorrow. \n[makes an implied request sound \nmore polite] \nperfect The perfect form of a verb generally \ncalls attention to the consequences \nof a prior event; for example, he has \ngone to lunch implies that he is still \naway, in contrast with he went to \nlunch. ‘Had gone to lunch’ takes a \npast time point (i.e. when we arrived) \nas its reference point and is another \nway of establishing time relations in \na text. The perfect tense is formed \nby: \n turning the verb into its past \nparticiple inflection"

For example: \n /t/ contrasts with /k/ to signal the \ndifference between tap and cap \n /t/ contrasts with /l/ to signal the \ndifference between bought and \nball. \nIt is this contrast in meaning that tells \nus there are two distinct phonemes \nat work. \nThere are around 44 phonemes in \nEnglish; the exact number depends \non regional accents.

The \nphrase is a noun phrase\n if its head is \na noun, a preposition phrase if its \nhead is a preposition, and so on; but \nif the head is a \nverb, the phrase is \ncalled a clause. Phrases can be \nmade up of other phrases. \nShe waved to her mother. [a noun \nphrase, with the noun mother as its \nhead] \nShe waved to her mother. [a \npreposition phrase, with the \npreposition to as its head] \nShe waved to her mother. [a \nclause, with the verb waved as its \nhead] \nplural A plural noun normally has a suffix –\ns or –es and means ‘more than one’. \nThere are a few nouns with different \nmorphology\n in the plural (e.g. mice, \nformulae). \ndogs [more than one dog]; boxes \n[more than one box] \nmice [more than one mouse] \npossessive A possessive can be: \n a noun followed by an \napostrophe, with or without s \n a possessive pronoun. \nThe relation expressed by a \npossessive goes well beyond \nordinary ideas of ‘possession’. \nA possessive may act as a \ndeterminer\n. \nTariq’s book [Tariq has the book] \nThe boys’ arrival [the boys arrive] \nHis obituary [the obituary is about \nhim] \nThat essay is mine.

[describes a state \nthat is true now] \nThe bus arrives at three. \n[scheduled now] \nMy friends are coming to play. \n[describes a plan in progress now] \nprogressive The progressive (also known as the \n‘continuous’) form of a verb\n generally \ndescribes events in progress. It is \nformed by combining the verb’s \npresent \nparticiple (e.g. singing) with \na form of the verb be (e.g. he was \nsinging). The progressive can also \nbe combined with the \nperfect (e.g. he \nhas been singing). \nMichael is singing in the store \nroom. [present progressive] \nAmanda was making a patchwork \nquilt. [past progressive] \nUsha had been practising for an \nhour when I called. [past perfect \nprogressive] \npronoun Pronouns are normally used like \nnouns\n, except that: \n they are grammatically more \nspecialised \n it is harder to modify\n them \nIn the examples, each sentence is \nwritten twice: once with nouns, and \nonce with pronouns (underlined). \nWhere the same thing is being talked \nabout, the words are shown in bold. \nAmanda waved to Michael. \nShe waved to him\n. \nJohn’s mother is over there.

Because of its regional \nneutrality, it is the accent which is \ngenerally shown in dictionaries in the \nUK (but not, of course, in the USA). \nRP has no special status in the \nnational curriculum. \nregister Classroom lessons, football \ncommentaries and novels use \ndifferent registers of the same \nlanguage, recognised by differences \nof vocabulary and grammar. \nRegisters are ‘varieties’ of a \nlanguage which are each tied to a \nrange of uses, in contrast with \ndialects, which are tied to groups of \nusers. \nI regret to inform you that Mr \nJoseph Smith has passed away. \n[formal letter] \nHave you heard that Joe has died? \n[casual speech] \nJoe falls down and dies, centre \nstage. [stage direction] \nrelative clause A relative clause is a special type of \nsubordinate clause that modifies a \nnoun. It often does this by using a \nrelative pronoun such as who or that \nto refer back to that noun, though the \nrelative pronoun that is often omitted. \nA relative clause may also be \nattached to a clause\n. In that case, \nthe pronoun refers back to the whole \nclause, rather than referring back to \na noun. \nIn the examples, the relative clauses \nare underlined, and both the\npronouns and the words\n they refer \nback to are in bold. \nThat’\ns the boy who lives near \nschool. [who refers back to boy] \nThe prize that I won was a book. \n[that refers back to prize] \nThe prize I won was a book. [the \npronoun that is omitted] \nTom broke the game, which \nannoyed Ali. [which refers back to \nthe whole clause] \nroot word Morphology breaks words down into \nroot words, which can stand alone, \nand \nsuffixes or prefixes which can’t. \nFor example, help is the root word \nfor other words in its word family \nsuch as helpful and helpless, and \nalso for its inflections such as \nhelping. Compound words (e.g. help-\ndesk) contain two or more root \nwords. When looking in a dictionary, \nwe sometimes have to look for the \nplayed [the root word is play] \nunfair [the root word is fair] \nfootball [the root words are foot \nand ball] \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n21 \nTerm Guidance Example \nroot word (or words) of the word we \nare interested in. \nschwa The name of a vowel sound that is \nfound only in unstressed positions in \nEnglish. It is the most common vowel \nsound in English. \nIt is written as /ə/ in the International \nPhonetic Alphabet. In the English \nwriting system, it can be written in \nmany different ways. \n/əlɒŋ/ [\n/bʌtə/ [\n/dɒktə/\nalong] \nbutter] \n [doctor] \nsentence A sentence is a group of words \nwhich are grammatically connected \nto each other but not to any words \noutside the sentence. \nThe form of a sentence’s main \nclause shows whether it is being \nused as a statement, a question, a \ncommand or an exclamation. \nA sentence may consist of a single \nclause or it may contain several \nclauses held together by \nsubordination or co-ordination. \nClassifying sentences as ‘simple’, \n‘complex’ or ‘compound’ can be \nconfusing, because a ‘simple’ \nsentence may be complicated, and a \n‘complex’ one may be \nstraightforward. The terms ‘single-\nclause sentence’ and ‘multi-clause \nsentence’ may be more helpful. \nJohn went to his friend’s house. \nHe \nstayed there till tea-time. \nJohn went to his friend’s house, he \nstayed there till tea-time. [This is a \n‘comma splice’, a common error in \nwhich a comma is used where \neither a full stop or a semi-colon is \nneeded to indicate the lack of any \ngrammatical connection between \nthe two clauses.] \nYou are my friend.

[single-clause \nsentence] \nShe went shopping but took back \neverything she had bought \nbecause she didn’t like any of it. \n[multi-clause sentence] \nsplit digraph See digraph. \nStandard English Standard English can be recognised \nby the use of a very small range of \nforms such as those books, I did it \nand I wasn’t doing anything (rather \nthan their non-Standard equivalents); \nit is not limited to any particular \naccent. It is the variety of English \nwhich is used, with only minor \nI did it because they were not \nwilling to undertake any more work \non those houses. [formal Standard \nEnglish] \nI did it cos they wouldn’t do any \nmore work on those houses. \n[casual Standard English] \nEnglish – key stage 3 \n22 \nTerm Guidance Example \nvariation, as a major world language. \nSome people use Standard English \nall the time, in all situations from the \nmost casual to the most formal, so it \ncovers most \nregisters. The aim of the \nnational curriculum is that everyone \nshould be able to use Standard \nEnglish as needed in writing and in \nrelatively formal speaking. \nI done it cos they wouldn’t do no \nmore work on them houses. \n[casual non-Standard English] \nstress A syllable is stressed if it is \npronounced more forcefully than the \nsyllables next to it. The other \nsyllables are unstressed. \nabout \nvisit \nsubject The subject of a verb is normally the \nnoun, noun phrase or pronoun\n that \nnames the ‘do-er’ or ‘be-er’. The \nsubject’s normal position is: \n just before the verb in a \nstatement \n just after the auxiliary verb, in a \nquestion. \nUnlike the verb’s object and \ncomplement, the subject can \ndetermine the form of the verb (e.g. I \nam, you are). \nRula’s mother went out. \nThat is uncertain. \nThe children will study the animals. \nWill the children study the animals? \nsubjunctive In some languages, the inflections of \na verb include a large range of \nspecial forms which are used \ntypically in \nsubordinate clauses, and \nare called ‘subjunctives’.
